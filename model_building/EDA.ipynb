    "Traps were placed around Chicago to help track the amount of mosquitoes in different areas.\n",

    "Each row represents one test of a mosquito pool from a specific trap on a specific date, with \n",
    "results indicating whether WNV was detected. This surveillance data helps public health officials \n",
    "monitor mosquito-borne virus activity, assess risk to humans, and guide mosquito control efforts.\n",

    "Ideally, the main goal is to build an accurate predictive model to help predict when there are \n",

    "who are infected do not have symptoms (at least initially), but some do; Said symptoms include\n",
    "fever, headaches, body aches, and skin rashes. In rare circumstances, WNV can be life-threatening \n",
    "if it enters the brain, causing Encephalitis (inflammation to the brain). Unfortunately there are no\n",
    "vaccines or treatments available, so the best way way to prevent getting WNV is to avoid mosquito \n",
