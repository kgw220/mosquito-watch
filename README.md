# Mosquito Watch

### Background
This project aims to analyze and model the distribution of the potentially deadly West Nile Virus 
around the Chicago area, as the local mosquito population can carry this virus.

West Nile Virus (WNV) is an infectious disease that was discovered in 1937 in the West Nile region 
of Uganda. It started spreading to the United States in 1999, via infected mosquitos. Most people
who are infected do not have symptoms (at least initially), but some do; Said symptoms include
fever, headaches, body aches, and skin rashes. In rare circumstances, WNV can be life-threatening 
if it enters the brain, causing Encephalitis (inflammation to the brain). Unfortunately there are no
vaccines or treatments available, so the best way way to prevent getting WNV is to avoid mosquito 
bites altogether.

Traps were placed around Chicago to help track the amount of mosquitoes in different areas.
They are then grouped into pools, and tested in a lab to determine if any in the group carry WNV. 
Each row represents one test of a mosquito pool from a specific trap on a specific date, with 
results indicating whether WNV was detected. This surveillance data helps public health officials 
monitor mosquito-borne virus activity, assess risk to humans, and guide mosquito control efforts.

The City of Chicago and the Chicago Public Health Department (CPHD) have resorted to spraying areas 
when WNV is detected to kill the infected mosquites and prevent the virus' spread. 

### Goal
The main goal is to build an accurate predictive model to help predict when there are 
spikes in WNV based on the historical data gathered thus far, which can help city officials more 
efficiently and effectively allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially 
deadly virus. Not only that, but further insights and (theoretical) propositions are given
based on the trends that were highlighted throughout the process.

### Methodology
This project is split up into different notebooks to help split up each major task. 

#### First Task
The first task is to gather the data. Mosquito trap data was pulled with City of Chicago's API. Originally, 
I had wanted to gather as much updated information  as possible, but I had issues with gathering related
data regarding spray applications from GIS and weather data from NOAA that was up to date. So, the data I
have covers the period from 2007 - 2014, which covers the rough time period where I was able to retrieve 
data for all 3 sources. Please refer to the Data Sources section at the very bottom of the README for 
more details on the exact source.
